hanging out with my son & amp ; my mom and working on other people 's wedding stuff while kyle works open-close ... today & amp ; tomorrow . 
i work at my college 's library so all the cute fire students are always coming in . it 's been raining a lot now and good luck ! 
i feel like i have arthritis in my hands from so much texting , piano , and being on the computer - the only things that keep me sane 
and if i did n't get out the bath , i 'd be sucked down the plughole and have to live with the spiders . i hate spiders . 
im starting to get that uncomfortable anxious feeling again . now im more of a “the cup is half empty ? kind of girl that i have ever been 
i 've never been the biggest fan of golf . then i watched tiger woods and was like wow this guy is awesome . then he started being human
